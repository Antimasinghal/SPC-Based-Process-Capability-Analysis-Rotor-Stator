## 📊 Statistical Process Control & Process Capability Analysis
   Rotor–Stator Lamination Manufacturing

🎓 Academic Minor Project | 🏭 Industrial Case Study | 📈 Quality Improvement Initiative

#### 🔎 Project Overview
This project focuses on implementing Statistical Process Control (SPC) and Process Capability Analysis (Cp, Cpk) to improve dimensional stability in rotor–stator lamination stack manufacturing.
The objective was to shift the quality system from a reactive inspection-based approach to a proactive statistical monitoring framework, ensuring long-term manufacturing stability and reduced variability.

#### 🎯 Objectives
- Monitor process stability using control charts
- Identify special causes of variation
- Improve Cp & Cpk values of critical dimensions
- Reduce process variability
- Establish a sustainable SPC monitoring system

#### 📏 Critical Quality Parameters
The following dimensions were identified as critical to assembly performance:
- Outer Diameter (OD)
- Inner Diameter (ID)
- Pitch Circle Diameter (PCD)

#### 📊 Process Capability Results
- OD	Unstable / Low Cpk	Cpk > 1.33
- ID	Marginal Stability	Cpk > 1.33
- PCD	Highly Critical	Cpk > 1.33

->Process brought under statistical control
Cp > 1.33
Cpk > 1.33
Manufacturing process confirmed stable and capable
